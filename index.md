## Overview

Ono On-The-Way is a web application that UH Manoa students can use when they do not want interrupt their work to go out for on-campus food. Students are able to register with the site as either a deliverer or a buyer. Buyers can request for food, and deliverers can fulfill the orders. The application is built using:
- [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
- [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) CSS Framework for UI design.
- [Uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) for React and Semantic UI-based form design and display.

### Goals 

Our goals for Ono On-The-Way is:
- To provide a directory of restaurants and vendors in or around the vicinity of the UH campus.
- Provide a facet for food to be delivered at a specific location on campus.
- Allows deliverers a list of orders to choose from, depending on location.

### Milestone 2: Data model development
The goal of Milestone 2 is to integrate other pages of the application such as ability for the customer to order and a deliver to accept the order. This involves the implemetation of our data model, which will include multiple schemas to ensure the data entered is is valid. 

The progress on these tasks can be seen [here](https://github.com/ono-otw/ono-otw/projects/2).


### Milestone 3: Final touches



## Extra enhancements
After implementing the basic functionality, some additional features may include:
- Expanding to not just food (eg. Art supplies from UH Manoa Bookstore)
- Expansion to mobile application 
- Login using UH Central Authentication Service to ensure that all users who sign in are UH Students
