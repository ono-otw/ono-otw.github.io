## Welcome to Ono On-The-Way

Ono On-The-Way is a web application that UH Manoa students can use when they do not want interrupt their work to go out for on-campus food. Students are able to register with the site as either a deliverer or a buyer. Buyers can request for food, and deliverers can fulfill the orders.

### Goals 

Our goals for Ono On-The-Way is:
- To provide a directory of restaurants and vendors in or around the vicinity of the UH campus.
- Provide a facet for food to be delivered at a specific location on campus.
- Allows deliverers a list of orders to choose from, depending on location.
